### The EUCS Under Fire: France’s Concerns Over Cybersecurity Sovereignty

The European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme (EUCS) has been the subject of increasing criticism, especially from France, where concerns over digital sovereignty and the role of U.S. cloud service providers dominate discussions. French authorities and experts fear that the EUCS, while aimed at bolstering European cybersecurity, may allow foreign tech giants to maintain dominance in Europe’s critical infrastructure, undermining efforts to develop local, sovereign cloud solutions.

Critics argue that the scheme’s current framework risks compromising European autonomy by relying on external cloud providers rather than fostering homegrown alternatives. This fear is heightened by the fact that many cloud services in Europe are operated by American firms that are subject to U.S. regulations, such as the Cloud Act, which allows the U.S. government access to data stored on American servers, even abroad.

### The Debate Over Sovereignty

France, a strong advocate for digital sovereignty, has long pushed for a more independent European cybersecurity policy, one that favors local solutions and guarantees the protection of EU citizens' data from external influence. Critics of the EUCS argue that by potentially opening doors to non-European service providers, the scheme threatens these goals, allowing foreign powers to retain access to sensitive European data.

In response to this controversy, France has been advocating for stricter requirements within the EUCS framework. These include favoring European cloud providers and ensuring that sensitive data related to European infrastructure remains entirely within EU borders. Without these safeguards, critics warn that Europe risks becoming increasingly dependent on non-European technologies, leaving it vulnerable to geopolitical risks and external pressures.

### Looking Forward: The Path to Reform

While the EUCS is an essential part of the EU’s cybersecurity strategy, its implementation has sparked debates about the balance between fostering innovation and maintaining digital independence. The criticisms from France could lead to revisions of the scheme, incorporating stricter criteria for cloud service providers and more robust safeguards for data sovereignty. As European nations push for a stronger, united cybersecurity front, the balance between openness and autonomy will be at the center of future discussions.

### Conclusion

The ongoing criticism of the EUCS highlights the complex challenge of securing European cyberspace while maintaining sovereignty. With France leading the charge, the debate over how best to protect European data in an increasingly globalized world continues, as the EU navigates the fine line between collaboration and independence.
